# Awesome Språk

Sprak is the langage used in the game [`else Heart.Break()`](http://elseheartbreak.com/) to write softwares on floppy disks, to run computers, and to modify effects of common objects such as coffee, beer, cigarettes, lamps, and mystical cubes.

This is the list of snippets, programs, clever tricks and games wrote by the player community.

# Food, liquids, etc.

- [nicoty's else-Heart.Break](https://gitlab.com/nicoty/else-Heart.Break)
  contains code for drinks, keys, modifiers, screwdrivers, and server functionality.
  Project supposedly migrated to [nest.pijul.com](https://nest.pijul.com/nicoty/else_heart_break_scripts)
  but that link is broken, so 
  [Github Mirror](https://github.com/VoidNoire/else-Heart.Break)

# Computers

- [BarbosaRMS' FakeDOS](https://github.com/BarbosaRMS/Sprak_FakeDOS)
  looks like a DOS terminal, and provides a filesystem and file editor, as well as
  experimental support for an assembly language.
- [IQGobo's EHBEHB](https://github.com/IQGobo/EHBEHB) provides an "Elite Hacker Board"
  similar to Neuromancer's Hiro Protagonist, as well as instructions for how to teleport
  it to you at will. Incredibly powerful.

## Floppy

## Network

### Slurp

- [Slurpie (Steam discussion)](https://steamcommunity.com/app/400110/discussions/0/487870763300928645/)
  uses a bootable floppy and a server to slurp around the world, and manage those connections.
- [The Teleporter 9000 (Steam discussion)](https://steamcommunity.com/app/400110/discussions/0/1696048245844467007/) - 
  Script to allow you to teleport from any computer. Updated 2020.

## Convenient menues

- Zinal001's [Convenient Menues](<Convenient Menues.txt>).

## Helper Functions


- Zinal001's [String Functions](<String Functions.txt>) and [Input Functions](Input.txt).
- [Array storage utilities (Steam Guide)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=646979331)
  allows arrays to be written and recalled from memory.
- [Serializable Type Library](https://steamcommunity.com/app/400110/discussions/0/490121928352987219/)
  provides functions to serialize and deserialize structured data.
  Pastebin has the [latest](https://pastebin.com/GDxee0Ns).
  It has *tests*.
  
# Games

# Mods

- Erik Svedäng provided a mini lab for building arcade games called the
  [SecretArcade](https://github.com/eriksvedang/SecretArcade/wiki). The
  wiki provides references for Sprak and the Arcade API, as well as community
  programs and download links for the lab itself. There's also a (mostly defunct)
  [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/988216627861325).
 - Svedäng also [released the source](https://github.com/eriksvedang/GameWorld2)
   of the core gameplay logic of the game, to make it easier for modders.
 - Itaros created an [Extended APIs mod with "EHBInjector"](https://github.com/Itaros/EHBExtendedAPI)
   that may no longer be directly useful but could be a reference for future mod work.

# META

- [SPRAK Manual (Steam guide)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=546973541) - 
  Copy of the in-game manual for ease of reference, with bonus list of in-game sound effects.
- [SPRAK Command Reference (Steam guide)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=612257262)
  Attempts to list all SPRAK primitives (excluding functions). May be out of date but still useful.
- Svedäng has [provided the source](https://github.com/eriksvedang/Grimm)
  for the GRIMM scripting language used in EHB. This includes Notepad++ and Textmate syntax
  highlighting plugins, but probably not the EHB specific APIs.
- [Master Floppy List (Steam guide)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1434554102)
  lists all the floppies in game and their contents. Full of spoilers, but handy.
- WLLR9505 has [translated EHB into Portuguese and Spanish](https://github.com/WLLR9505/ElseHeartBreak).
- [SVG map of Dorisburg](https://github.com/Feuermurmel/ehb-map-of-dorisburg).
  

## Syntax highlighting

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this list, you can fork it, send Pull Requests, or send a mail to me if you don't have an account here on github.  
I encourage self hosting and decentralization, so eh, I don't mind if you send me an email because you are not on github.  
If you want to share your code but you don't have a github account (or don't want to create a repo for it), mail it to me and I'll create the repo and credit you for it (again, if you want to be credited).  
I don't care if the list is not ordered alphabetically, it's ordered with the logic you want it to have.
