# Awesome Språk

Sprak is the langage used in the game `else Heart.Break()` to write softwares on floppy disks, to run computers, and to modify effects of common objects such as coffee, beer, cigarettes, lamps, and mystical cubes.

This is the list of snippets, programs, clever tricks and games wrote by the player community.

# Food, liquids, etc.

- [VoidNoire's else-Heart.Break](https://github.com/VoidNoire/else-Heart.Break)
  contains code for drinks, keys, modifiers, screwdrivers, and server functionality.

# Computers

- [BarbosaRMS' FakeDOS](https://github.com/BarbosaRMS/Sprak_FakeDOS)
  looks like a DOS terminal, and provides a filesystem and file editor, as well as
  experimental support for an assembly language.
- [IQGobo's EHBEHB](https://github.com/IQGobo/EHBEHB) provides an "Elite Hacker Board"
  similar to Neuromancer's Hiro Protagonist, as well as instructions for how to teleport
  it to you at will. Incredibly powerful.

- Erik Svedäng provided a mini lab for building arcade games called the
  [SecretArcade](https://github.com/eriksvedang/SecretArcade/wiki). The
  wiki provides references for Sprak and the Arcade API, as well as community
  programs and download links for the lab itself. There's also a (mostly defunct)
  [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/988216627861325).
 - Svedäng also [released the source](https://github.com/eriksvedang/GameWorld2)
   of the core gameplay logic of the game, to make it easier for modders.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this list, you can fork it, send Pull Requests, or send a mail to me if you don't have an account here on github.  
I encourage self hosting and decentralization, so eh, I don't mind if you send me an email because you are not on github.  
If you want to share your code but you don't have a github account (or don't want to create a repo for it), mail it to me and I'll create the repo and credit you for it (again, if you want to be credited).  
I don't care if the list is not ordered alphabetically, it's ordered with the logic you want it to have.
