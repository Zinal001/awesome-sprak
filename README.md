# Awesome Spr책k

Sprak is the langage used in the game `else Heart.Break()` to write softwares on floppy disks, to run computers, and to modify effects of common objects such as coffee, beer, cigarettes, lamps, and mystical cubes.

This is the list of snippets, programs, clever tricks and games wrote by the player community.

# Food, liquids, etc.

- [nicoty's else-Heart.Break](https://gitlab.com/nicoty/else-Heart.Break)
  contains code for drinks, keys, modifiers, screwdrivers, and server functionality.
  Project supposedly migrated to [nest.pijul.com](https://nest.pijul.com/nicoty/else_heart_break_scripts)
  but that link is broken, so 
  [Github Mirror](https://github.com/VoidNoire/else-Heart.Break)

# Computers

- [BarbosaRMS' FakeDOS](https://github.com/BarbosaRMS/Sprak_FakeDOS)
  looks like a DOS terminal, and provides a filesystem and file editor, as well as
  experimental support for an assembly language.
- [IQGobo's EHBEHB](https://github.com/IQGobo/EHBEHB) provides an "Elite Hacker Board"
  similar to Neuromancer's Hiro Protagonist, as well as instructions for how to teleport
  it to you at will. Incredibly powerful.

## Network

### Slurp

## Convenient menues

## Helper Functions

- [String Functions](./String Functions.txt)
- [Array storage utilities (Steam Guide)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=646979331)
  allows arrays to be written and recalled from memory.
  
# Games

# Mods

- Erik Sved채ng provided a mini lab for building arcade games called the
  [SecretArcade](https://github.com/eriksvedang/SecretArcade/wiki). The
  wiki provides references for Sprak and the Arcade API, as well as community
  programs and download links for the lab itself. There's also a (mostly defunct)
  [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/988216627861325).
 - Sved채ng also [released the source](https://github.com/eriksvedang/GameWorld2)
   of the core gameplay logic of the game, to make it easier for modders.

# META

- [SPRAK Manual (Steam guide)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=546973541) - 
  Copy of the in-game manual for ease of reference, with bonus list of in-game sound effects.
- [SPRAK Command Reference (Steam guide)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=612257262)
  Attempts to list all SPRAK primitives (excluding functions). May be out of date but still useful.
- Sved채ng has [provided the source](https://github.com/eriksvedang/Grimm)
  for the GRIMM scripting language used in EHB. This includes Notepad++ and Textmate syntax
  highlighting plugins, but probably not the EHB specific APIs.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this list, you can fork it, send Pull Requests, or send a mail to me if you don't have an account here on github.  
I encourage self hosting and decentralization, so eh, I don't mind if you send me an email because you are not on github.  
If you want to share your code but you don't have a github account (or don't want to create a repo for it), mail it to me and I'll create the repo and credit you for it (again, if you want to be credited).  
I don't care if the list is not ordered alphabetically, it's ordered with the logic you want it to have.
